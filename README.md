GraphQL Explorer is a project that simplifies the process of generating queries from plain text prompts. It harnesses the power of AI to make querying your GraphQL APIs a breeze.

## How It Works

This project utilizes the [ChatGPT API](https://openai.com/api/) and the [Vercel AI SDK](https://sdk.vercel.ai/docs) with streaming capabilities. Here's a quick overview of the workflow:

1. **User Input**: You input a text prompt or query in a user-friendly form.

2. **Prompt Construction**: The system constructs a query prompt based on the input.

3. **AI Magic**: The prompt is sent to the ChatGPT API using a Vercel Edge Function.

4. **Streamlined Response**: The AI-generated response is streamed back to the application's user interface, allowing you to view and use the generated query effortlessly.
